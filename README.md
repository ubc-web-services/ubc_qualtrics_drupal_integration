$ drush -y en views views_json views_ui
```

### Required custom modules:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ubc-web-services/ubc_qualtrics_drupal_integration.git
```
to download files. If not, you can choose to download a .zip file. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2751227/how-to-download-source-in-zip-format-from-github/#18583977) is a good reference.

## <div id="embedding-qualtrics-survey">How to embed a Qualtrics survey to a website:</div>
1. Download Drupal and start building your own Drupal website.
2. Create a basic page:
Go to __Content > Add content > Page__.
Select ![picture alt](screenshots/img15.png) button located at the bottom row of the text editing tools.
In Body field, add:<br />
```html
<iframe align="middle" frameborder="no" height="800px" name="qualtrics" scrolling="auto" src=[anonymous-survey-link] width="800px"></iframe>
```
![picture alt](screenshots/img14.png)
<br />
You can copy and paste the above line, but you __must__ replace the __[anonymous-survey-link]__ with your own.
<br />You can retrieve your own __[anonymous-survey-link]__ with the step-by-step [instruction](#anonymous-survey-link).
<br />In the case of demo, the link is https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0oiEz2f76DneukR.

3. Save the page to see the survey embedded to the designated page.
## <div id="responsive-survey">How to make an embedded survey responsive:</div>
1. Go to the page on your Drupal website with a Qualtrics survey embedded from the previous step and click __Edit__.
2. In the __Body__ field, add a containing wrapper around `iframe`. You can choose to copy and paste the below example:
```html
<div class="embedded-survey">
	<iframe align="middle" frameborder="no" height="800px" name="qualtrics" scrolling="auto" src=[Anonymous Survey Link] width="800px">
	</iframe>
</div>
```
3. Add the below line of code in your CSS file or wrap around `<style>` tag:
```css
.embedded-survey {
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    height: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
}
.embedded-survey iframe {
    position: absolute;
    top:0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}
```
4. Click __Save__.

## <div id="anonymous-survey-link">How to get [anonymous-survey-link]:</div>
1. Go to Qualtrics website and login using your CWL account.
2. Create a survey for demo.
![picture alt](screenshots/img8.png)
For the purpose of demo, I created a survey titled as ___Test: Course Evaluation___.
3. Click the survey title to see the page similar to this:
![picture alt](screenshots/img9.png)
4. Go to __Distribution__ tab located at the top of the page, and the link will be provided when the page is loaded.
![picture alt](screenshots/img10.png)

## <div id="exporting-json-feeds">How to export JSON feeds from Drupal to Qualtrics:</div>
1. Create a page view:
Go to __Structure > Views > Add new view__ and select __Create a page__. Click __Continue & Edit__.
Under __Format__ field, click __Unformatted list__.
Click __JSON data document__ and click __Apply (all displays)__.
![picture alt](screenshots/img16.png)

<strong>For the advanced Drupal developers:</strong> you can choose to select __Fields__ instead of __Contents__ to export fields of your choice. Moreover, you can choose different display modes(e.x. Default, etc.) other than __Teaser__ demonstrated in our example for a desired display style.

2. Once saved, you will be able to see the preview at the bottom of the page that is similar to this:
```
{
  "nodes" : [
    {
      "node" : {
        "title" : "Wood Products Processing"
      }
    },
    {
      "node" : {
        "title" : "Statistics"
      }
    },
    {
      "node" : {
        "title" : "Pharmacy"
      }
    },
...
```
If you click __Settings__ next to JSON data document under __Format__ field, you can modify root object name (___nodes___ in this demo) and top-level child object(___node___ in this demo).

## <div id="create-autocomplete-question">How to create an Autocomplete question type using imported JSON feeds on Qualtrics</div>
1. Go to Qualtrics website and login using your CWL account.

2. Create a survey, or locate the existing survey that you wish to import JSON feeds from your Drupal website.

3. To create an __autocomplete text field__, create a question of type __Single Line__ under __Text Entry__.

![picture alt](screenshots/img32.png)

Then, right-click the question card of interest to locate __Add JavaScript__ option.

![picture alt](screenshots/img21.png)

Copy and paste the code provided below:

In jQuery:
```javascript
Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function() {
    $.getJSON('https://[YOUR_SITE_DOMAIN/ENDPOINT]', function(data) {
        var nodes = data.nodes;
        var availableTags = [];
        $.each(nodes, function(key, node) {
          availableTags.push(node.node.title);
        });
        var org_html = '<input type="TEXT" autocomplete="off" id="QR~QIDXX" value="" class="InputText QR-QIDXX QWatchTimer ui-autocomplete-input" name="QR~QIDXX~TEXT" data-runtime-textvalue="runtime.Value" style="width: 324px;" aria-describedby="QR~QIDXX~VALIDATION">'
        var new_html = '<div id="ui-widget">' + org_html + '</div>';
        $('.QR-QIDXX').html(new_html);
        $(".QR-QIDXX").autocomplete({
            source: availableTags
        });
    });
});
```
__IMPORTANT:__ Note that __QR~QIDXX__ and __QR-QIDXX__ are unique to each question, and they need to be replaced. You can find the last two digits of your question ID's and classes by going to the preview of your survey, inspect the page and hover over the question of your interest and look for __ID__.

![picture alt](screenshots/img29.png)

In this case, the question ID is __QR~QID80__, highlighted in ___orange___ color.
![picture alt](screenshots/img30.png)

Your __[YOUR_SITE_DOMAIN/ENDPOINT]__ is the path assigned to your page view created for exporting JSON feeds.

4. Click __save__ button, and find ![picture alt](screenshots/img22.png) button on top of the page.

5. Click and you will see a pop-up window that looks like this:

![picture alt](screenshots/img23.png)

6. Click __Advanced__ option and add below lines to __Header__ section:
```html
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/resources/demos/style.css">
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js"></script>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
```

7. Click __save__ button, and click ![picture alt](screenshots/img24.png) to have a preview look of your survey.

## <div id="developers-info">For Developers: Guide to Debug</div>
### If questions are not displayed properly or failed to retrieve JSON feeds from Qualtrics side:
There is a quick way to check whether Qualtrics Drupal Integration module has been set up properly in __Firefox__.<br />
1. Go to your website and locate the page view with the JSON feeds you wish to export.
2. At the top of the browser, there are three tabs: __JSON, Raw Data, and Headers__. If you click __Headers__, you should see Access-Control-Allow-Origin header similar to this:

![picture alt](screenshots/img28.png)
<br />under __Response Headers__.

3. If not, you would want to go back to your Drupal website and see if the __module has been installed and enabled__, and make sure that __all the caches are cleared__.

### When adding custom CSS or JavaScript files in Drupal
By default, Drupal automatically optimizes external resources to reduce both the size and number of requests made to your website.
Hence, you want to make sure that these options are disabled in order to properly load your custom CSS and JavaScript files:
1. Go to __Configuration > Development > Performance__ or simply __admin/config/development/performance__.
2. Under __Bandwidth Optimization__, disable all three options: Compress cached pages, Aggregate and compress CSS files, and Aggregate JavaScript files.
![picture alt](screenshots/img27.png)
3. Click __Save Configuration__.
